## toy_1

Cluster and visualize dbscan.csv using DBSCAN (epsilon = 7.5, MinPts = 3). <br/><br />
Execute the DBSCAN algorithm point-by-point logging your work.

## toy_2

Run your own implementation of DBSCAN on circles.csv, blobs.csv, and moons.csv

## 20ng, household

Run your DBSCAN algorithm on the 20NG dataset, and the Household dataset and evaluate results. <br /><br />
Implement both phases <br />(1) neighborhoods creation,<br /> (2) DBSCAN.<br /><br />
Perform trial and error for parameters epsilon and MinPts
