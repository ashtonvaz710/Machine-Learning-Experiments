Feature selection - 
Datasets: 20ng, spambase, mnist
- Runs l2 regularized logistic regression and decision tree on entire datasets as 
baseline performance
- using l2 regularized logistic regression and decision tree to select k best features

PCA - 
Datasets: spambase, mnist
Comparing my own PCA algorithm vs scikit's PCA library vs baseline (without PCA)

Mutual Information, chi-squared, L1 regularized Logistic Regression -
Datasets: 20ng
Reconstructing dataset with top k features using above algorithms and comparing 
performance with baseline

HARR - 
Datsets: mnist
Reconstructing dataset with HARR feature extraction and comparing performance with 
baseline
