## Feature selection
-- Run l2 regularized logistic regression and decision tree on entire datasets as baseline performance <br />
-- Use l2 regularized logistic regression and decision tree to select and display k best features
<br /> <br />
Datasets: 20NG, MNIST, SpamBase

## PCA
Compare self-implemented PCA algorithm vs scikit's PCA library vs baseline (without PCA)
<br /> <br />
Datasets: MNIST, SpamBase

## Mutual Information, chi-squared, L1 regularized Logistic Regression
Reconstructing dataset with top k features using given algorithms and comparing performance with baseline
<br /> <br />
Datasets: 20NG

## HARR
