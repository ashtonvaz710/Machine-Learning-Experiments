### Feature selection  
Datasets: 20NG, MNIST, SpamBase
-- Run l2 regularized logistic regression and decision tree on entire datasets as baseline performance
-- Use l2 regularized logistic regression and decision tree to select and display k best features

### PCA  
Datasets: MNIST, SpamBase
-- Compare self-implemented PCA algorithm vs scikit's PCA library vs baseline (without PCA)

### Mutual Information, chi-squared, L1 regularized Logistic Regression 
Datasets: 20NG
-- Reconstructing dataset with top k features using given algorithms and comparing performance with baseline

### HARR 
Datasets: MNIST
-- Reconstructing dataset with HARR feature extraction and comparing performance with baseline
