### Classification
Datasets: 20NG, MNIST
-- Run TF in supervised mode for classification

### Autoencoders
Datasets: 20NG, MNIST, FASHION, SpamBase
-- Run TF as an autoencoder
-- Verify the obtained re-encoding of data

### Word vectors
Datasets: 20NG, WIKI
-- Run word-vectors embedding into 300 dimensions using TF
-- Use a visulaizer that loads your embedding, projects it in 3 dimensions and displays the words
